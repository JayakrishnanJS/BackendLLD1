        // method because it does not need to be instantiated. It is a factory because it creates
        // an instance of a class.
        // The complete steps to implement the simple factory pattern are:
        // 1. Factory class - Create a factory class that contains a static method for creating
        // objects.
        // 2. Conditional - Use a conditional statement to create the object based on the input.
        // 3. Request - Request an object from the factory class without having to know the class
        // of the object that will be returned.

        button.click();

    }
}
// Pros :
// 1. Moved the component creation logic to a separate factory class and decoupled it from the client code.

// Cons :
// 1. Still requires modification of the factory class to add new platform types, which violates the Open/Closed Principle.
// 2. Still has ifâ€“else statements, which can lead to code that is hard to maintain and extend.
