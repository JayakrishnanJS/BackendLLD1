    // - Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface
    //   for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    //   It promotes loose coupling by allowing the client code to work with abstract types rather
    //   than concrete implementations.

    // - cleanly separates factory (the family) from product creators, which can make it
    //   clearer when you have lots of products in each family or want to inject/mock factories independently.
    // Use: Creating families of related products, using composition.
    // Focus: Multiple related products, factory object decides all products. Abstract Factory is more scalable for families of products.
    /*
     1. Abstract product interface - Create an interface for the products that will be
        created by the factory.

     2. Concrete products - Create concrete classes that implement the product interface.

     3. Abstract factory interface - Create an interface for the abstract factory that will
        be used to create the products.

    4. Concrete factories - Create concrete classes that implement the abstract factory
        interface.

    5. Client code - Request an object from the factory class without having to know the
        class of the object that will be returned.

// Pros :
// 1. Promotes loose coupling by allowing the client code to work with abstract types.
// 2. Easy to add new families of products without modifying existing code (OCP).
// 3. Clear separation of concerns; maintainable and extensible.
// 4. No if‚Äìelse in Client; consistent interface for related objects.
// 5. Easier to test and mock due to separation.
// 6. Organizes related product families together; highly readable.
// 7. Supports runtime configuration of families without changing Client.

 * ============================
 * Factory Method vs Abstract Factory
 * ============================
 *
 * üîπ Factory Method (V2)
 * - The "creator" (e.g., Platform) is itself a product with other responsibilities.
 * - Subclasses (AndroidPlatform, IOSPlatform) override factory methods
 *   like createButton() / createDropdown() to produce platform-specific components.
 * - Focus: on the *methods* that subclasses override.
 * - Abstract class contains both creation methods + other behaviors or data.
 * - Creation = via inheritance.
 * - Client depends on: abstract class (Platform).
 *
 * üîπ Abstract Factory (V3)
 * - The "factory" (e.g., UIComponentFactory) exists solely to create families of products.
 * - Concrete factories (AndroidUIComponentFactory, IOSUIComponentFactory) ensure
 *   all created objects belong to the same family (Android / iOS).
 * - Focus: on the *factory object* itself.
 * - Abstract class or Interface contains only creation methods.
 * - Creation = via composition.
 * - Client depends on: factory interface (UIComponentFactory).


 Factory Method: Subclass decides what to create.
 Abstract Factory: Factory object decides, ensuring consistent product families.

 * ‚úÖ Summary:
 * Factory Method ‚Üí Class hierarchy decides *how* to create products.
 * Abstract Factory ‚Üí Separate object dedicated *only* to creating consistent families of products.

Analogy:
Think of a family as a themed furniture set:

Abstract Factory: One shop gives you a table, chair, and sofa that all match in style (say ‚ÄúScandinavian‚Äù).
‚Üí Everything fits together = one family.

Factory Method: You might make each furniture piece yourself ‚Äî still furniture, but no built-in guarantee that all match.
‚Üí Each creation method is independent.

| Aspect            | Factory Method                                     | Abstract Factory                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Who owns creation | A product class with other duties (e.g., Platform) | A separate, dedicated factory object                  |
| Purpose           | Creation is *one role*                             | Creation is the *only role*                           |
| Object‚Äôs identity | Represents something real (like iOS)               | Represents a factory itself                           |
| Example           | `IOSPlatform extends Platform`                     | `IOSUIComponentFactory implements UIComponentFactory` |


üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Platform is a real object with identity + behavior

        IOSPlatform represents iOS itself ‚Äî it might also have behaviors like version info, theme, or platform-level logic.
        It just happens to know how to create UI components (createButton, createDropdown).
        So creation is one of its jobs, not its whole purpose.
        That‚Äôs why it fits the Factory Method pattern ‚Äî creation via overridden methods in subclasses.

üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ IOSUIComponentFactory exists only to create components

        It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù iOS ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt have data or behavior about the platform.
        It‚Äôs solely dedicated to producing iOS-style UI elements.
        Its only identity = ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a factory for a consistent family of UI products.‚Äù
        That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs Abstract Factory ‚Äî a whole object whose single purpose is creation, not general behavior.

| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level of abstraction            | Method-level                              | Object-level                                                            |
| Object responsible for creation | Subclass (via inheritance)                | Separate factory (via composition)                                      |
| Main focus                      | One product type                          | Family of related products                                              |
| Example in your text            | `Platform` (AndroidPlatform, iOSPlatform) | `UIComponentFactory` (AndroidUIComponentFactory, iOSUIComponentFactory) |


Quick Development Rules

    1. If creation belongs to a ‚Äúreal object‚Äù ‚Üí Factory Method.
    2. If creation needs guaranteed consistency across multiple product types ‚Üí Abstract Factory.
    3. If you want independent factories for testing, reuse, or swapping families ‚Üí Abstract Factory.
